Program Idea: For our program 1 we want to create a program that can be used in a vet office. The program will keep inventory of animals checked in and keep a balance of charges. The program will also have options for different procedurs along with their cost. It will then print out your charges after check out. 

The program will start with a menu that has the options for check in or check out. When the user chooses check in, the program will starting reading to a .txt file about your animal and etc. If the user chooses check out, then it will read from the .txt file and allow the user to choose which animal is theirs. Once the user chooses their animal and what operations were done, thier charges and operations will be printed.
